# Credits and Acknowledgments

This repository is an independent implementation created for thesis research purposes. It is based on the original MNCA (Mixture Neural Cellular Automata) implementation and research.

## Original MNCA Implementation

The core MNCA models and implementation in this repository are based on:

- **Original Repository:** [https://github.com/Militeee/MNCA](https://github.com/Militeee/MNCA)
- **Research Paper:** [2506.20486v1.pdf](papers/2506.20486v1.pdf) (arXiv:2506.20486)
- **Title:** Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata
- **Authors:** Original authors of the Mixture Neural Cellular Automata paper

We gratefully acknowledge the original authors for their foundational work on Mixture Neural Cellular Automata, which extends traditional Neural Cellular Automata by integrating probabilistic rules and intrinsic noise.

## Base NCA Implementation

The base Neural Cellular Automata implementation (`mix_NCA/NCA.py`) is adapted from:

- **Repository:** [https://github.com/greydanus/studying_growth](https://github.com/greydanus/studying_growth)
- **Description:** An excellent introduction to Neural Cellular Automata with associated blog post

## This Repository

This is an **independent repository** created for thesis research. While the code is based on the original MNCA implementation, it has been:

- **Adapted and extended** for comprehensive evaluation and analysis
- **Reorganized** to support specific thesis research objectives
- **Enhanced** with additional experimental frameworks
- **Focused** on biological simulations and microscopy image applications

The repository is not a fork of the original project, but rather a standalone codebase developed for the thesis project: *"Comprehensive Assessment of Mixture Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA) for Modeling Complex Biological Systems"*.
